## Benchmark

Load testing API for Golang, Java, and Python. It returns a JSON response with the status "ok." 
The test runs for 60 seconds using 300 concurrent connections. 
System specifications: 8GB RAM, Intel 6200U processor, and Windows 10.

Frameworks used for this test:
- Golang with Gin
- Java with Spring Boot
- Python with FastAPI

| Language | Reqs/sec | Latency (ms) | Total |
| Golang   | 2658.11  | 124.93       | 36094 |
| Java     | 776.98   | 406.33       | 11225 |
| Python   | 174.02   | 1970.00      | 2398  |

## Conclusion

Based on my experience developing with these three languages and benchmarking them, here is my conclusion:

Golang : Speed and scalibity
Java   : Enterprise robustness and vast ecosytem
Python : Simplicity and rapid development
